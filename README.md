# DevelopingDataProducts-ShinyApp-Documentation

This tool is developed as a part of the course reproducible research provided in Coursera's Data Science Specialization.

The tool explores the mtcars dataset. Specifically it plots out:

1. MPG vs Displacement for different number of cylinders.
2. MPG vs Displacement for different number of carburetors.

## To view how displacement changes with MGP for cars based on different number of cylinders:
1) Please select the number of cylinders from the user SelectInput box: Cylinders.
2) Go to the Cylinders tab to view the behavior of different cars displacement with respect to MPG for the selected number of cylinders.

## To view how displacement changes with MGP for cars based on different number of carburetors:
1) Please select the number of carburetors from the user SelectInput box: Carburetors.
2) Go to the Carburetors tab to view the behavior of different cars displacement with respect to MPG for the selected number of carburetors.
